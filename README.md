Pick a class and a battleground, then survive: WASD to move, your abilities cast themselves,
enemies swarm in waves, you level up and pick upgrades, and a boss shows up every couple of
minutes. **No server, no login, no account** — fully offline and self-contained.

### In this build

- **A character-create pick screen** built from the client's own glue art: eight races, both
  genders, every class the race can be, and **sixteen zones**, from the starting zones to
  Naxxramas and the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj. Each zone fights with its own creatures and bosses, taken
  from the zone's real spawns. Your pick is remembered across reloads.
- **Level-up cards** that deal in, tilt toward the cursor and lift on hover. Their WoW item-quality
  colour says how strong a pick is, and each card lists exactly what changes, like
  `Damage 20 » 26` or `Targets 2 » 3`.
- **A class movement spell on F** from level 5, aimed where you face (at the cursor in the
  classic view): Blink, Charge, Sprint, Dash, Fade, Ghost Wolf, Aspect of the Cheetah, Blessing of
  Freedom, Howl of Terror.
- **WoW's own camera and movement:** behind the hero, with mouselook, A/D turning and Q/E
  strafing, and the hero bumping into trees and buildings. **V** swaps to the classic top-down view
  with the hero facing the cursor, and the wheel zooms either.
- A light sharpen-and-colour pass over the picture (**G** toggles it).

## Play it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OutThisLife/azeroth-survivors-re
cd azeroth-survivors-re
make build     # fetch game data + install toolchain + build the wasm (~5.5 GB download)
make start     # → open http://127.0.0.1:8090/
```

`make build` chains three re-runnable scripts, each skipping what's already done:

| Step | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/fetch-data.sh` | downloads the WoW 1.12.1 client and extracts its MPQs |
| `scripts/web-setup.sh` | installs the wasm toolchain (wasi-sdk, wasm-bindgen, binaryen) |
| `scripts/web-build.sh` | builds the client into `web/dist/` |

**Prerequisites:** [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), `make`, `curl`, `unzip`.

Run `make` (or `make help`) to list every target.

## Controls

See [CONTROLS.md](CONTROLS.md). The short version: **WASD** to move, **Space** to jump, **F**
for your class's movement spell, the **mouse wheel** to zoom, **V** to swap to the top-down view,
**Esc** to pause, **1/2/3** to pick a level-up card.

## The game data (not in this repo)

This repo ships **no Blizzard content** — no art, models, sounds, maps, MPQ contents, or
FrameXML. The game reads a WoW 1.12.1 client's `Data` folder at runtime, which you supply.

`make build` (via `scripts/fetch-data.sh`) downloads the **English WoW 1.12.1 (build 5875)**
client from [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/WoW_1.12.1-5875) (~5.5 GB) and extracts the
MPQs into `wow-data/Data/` (git-ignored, resumable, skipped when already present). Or point at a
client you already have with `--data` / `WOW_DATA`.

### Changing the download source

If the archive.org item moves or you have your own mirror, override the URL without editing
anything:

```bash
make build WOW_DATA_URL=https://your-mirror.example/client.zip
```

Or set it permanently by editing the single clearly-marked `DEFAULT_DATA_URL` line at the top of
`scripts/fetch-data.sh`. Either way the URL must be a direct link to a zip holding the client's
`Data/*.MPQ` files.

## How it's built

The survivors mode is `crates/benilla-app/src/survivors/`, running on two upstream projects:

- [benilla](https://github.com/samwhosung/benilla) — a from-scratch WoW 1.12.1 client.
- [wenilla](https://github.com/Arnesen/wenilla) — benilla compiled to WebAssembly, with a local
  host and realm service.
